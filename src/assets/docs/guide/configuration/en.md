## Configuration

Once the plugin is imported, you'll have access to a global property `$ecosphere` (or `this.$ecosphere` depending on where it's used) which will expose some helper functions.

#### Theme

The configuration helpers for theme will be availble under `this.$ecosphere.theme` in the global property.
