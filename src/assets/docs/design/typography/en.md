### Bayesâ€™ Theorem

#### Intuition

Let's take the example of an experiment mentioned in the book **Thinking, Fast and Slow** by **Daniel Kahneman**.

###### The question

_Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful, but with very little interest in people, or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail. Is Steve is a Librarian or a Farmer?_

As we read the above description, we naturally start to think that this fits the description of a librarian (stereotype), and if indeed a farmer turns up fitting this description, it's something unexpected. However, what would also heavily matter in determining the probability, is the ratio of farmers to that of librarians.

###### Starting assumptions

- Let's take the **ratio of farmers to librarians** in the US, which is around **20 to 1**
- **Multiply with 10** on each side for convenience in calculations and understanding
- Let's assume that the likelihood of fitting the description is around **40% for librarians** and **10% for farmers**

#### Probability with Evidence

Now if we want to find the probability of Steve being a librarian, considering the ratio of farmers to librarians,

_**P(Librarian | Description) = 16.7%**_

_Even though we think that a librarian is 4 times as likely as a farmer, to fit this description, it's still not enough to overcome the fact that there are way more farmers than librarians._
