##### Design Principles

- **Accessibile**: Accessibility is a core principle of Ecosphere. Components are designed to be accessible and easy to use, even for challenged individuals. The design system is built with accessibility in mind.
- **Muted Colours**: Colours are muted, with a neutral-heavy theme to create a sense of uniformity and brightness. A lot of whites and greys are utilised to create contrast.
- **Decluttered & Minimal**: The "Less is more" principle is used to create a decluttered design system. Excessive detailing or utilities are purposefully avoided. The result is a minimal, beautiful and efficient design system.
- **Responsive & Flexible**: The design system is responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes. Each and every component is designed to be flexible and responsive.
- **Practical, Purposeful & Functional**: Purposeful and practical design is a core principle of Ecosphere. Every element has a function and serves an unique purpose.

##### Features

- **TypeScript**: Components are built with TypeScript. This means that every component is written in TypeScript and can be used in TypeScript applications as well.
- **Vue 3**: Can be used in Vue 3 applications, including Nuxt 3.
- **Router Support**: Supports Vue Router out of the box, can detect and highlight active routes.
- **Moderen Browsers**: Supports all modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera, IE11 and more.
- **CSS Variables**: CSS variables are used to create a more dynamic design system. These variables are also customisable and can be used in the themeing system.
- **Electron**: Supports Electron applications.

##### Remix Icon

Ecosphere uses [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/) in the design system. They have a beautiful collection of simple, elegant and practical icons that fits right into the design system.
